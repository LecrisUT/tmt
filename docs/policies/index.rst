    Policies (Deprecations)
==============================

During the development of tmt, we will introduce some behavior changes,
particularly in how the fmf files are interpreted. In order to preserve
backwards compatibility during a transition period, we will introduce some
(deprecation) policies.

What you can find in these policies are:

* A summary of the policy change
* The tmt version when the policy was introduced
* The OLD deprecated interface
* The NEW interface to use and a transition guide
* A preliminary deadline when the OLD interface will be removed
